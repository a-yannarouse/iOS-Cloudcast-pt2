## Overview

CloudCast Part 2 is an iOS application developed during Week 5 of the iOS101 course. This project focuses on fetching and displaying **real weather data** from the Open-Meteo API while demonstrating key iOS concepts such as networking with URLSession, JSON parsing with the Decodable protocol, and dynamic UI updates.

## Goals

- **APIs & Postman:**  
  Learn how to create and inspect web requests using Postman.
  
- **Networking:**  
  Implement asynchronous network calls using URLSession.

- **JSON Parsing:**  
  Convert JSON data into Swift models using the Decodable protocol.

- **Dynamic UI:**  
  Enable users to switch between multiple locations to view live weather data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data:**  
  Retrieves current weather details including temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and weather conditions.

- **Multiple Locations:**  
  Allows users to switch between pre-defined locations (e.g., San Jose, Manila, Italy).

- **Clean & Responsive UI:**  
  Built with UIKit for an intuitive user experience.

- **Robust Networking:**  
  Utilizes URLSession and JSONDecoder for effective data handling.
